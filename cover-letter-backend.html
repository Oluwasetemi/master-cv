        Hello, This letter is to express my interest in your posting for the
        role of a Backend Engineer. With a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer
        Science, hands-on experience using JavaScript and Nodejs to create
        software applications. Much more with constant learning and self
        development accompanied by curiosity with passion to built software
        products. I have good understanding of JavaScript as a language,
        mastering its core features and core language concepts ranging from DOM
        manipulation, New web API, Node core API, its evolution through each
        EcmaScript iteration, to its latest and tracking of new features.

        I enjoy being challenged and engaged with the prospect of seeing a software
        development lifecycle through to a product with quality architecture using
        adequate design principles and agile methodology using technologies like
        graphQL or RESTful api or microservice architecture on the backend
        using JavaScript, React, Nextjs, HTML, PUG, CSS to creating visually
        appealing user interface for products that connect people to business
        and becoming a world class developer is the core of my vision which I
        believe will be of value to your organization and her global partners.
