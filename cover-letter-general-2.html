            Hello,

            I have worked as a Full-Stack Software Developer from the beginner of my web development career due to my passion for both the frontend and backend of web development. I have worked with JavaScript, Nodejs and Python (minimal exposure in production) and C# (minimal exposure in production). I love Reactjs and GraphQL so dearly. I can handle continuous Integrations, Software Testing (e2e, Integration, Unit and static analysis), Dev Ops with both Digital Ocean and AWS.

            My love for JavaScript has been my motivation for software development. I have built several products as an Employee, Freelance and Contractor. I am a professional(https://oluwasetemi.dev/hello-world) with good work ethic and communication skills. I blog about what I learn and I love to teach anyone programming and web development. I build software product to design Requirement using the right architectures.
